# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This app allows you to see the current and future weather outlook for multiple cities. The current forecast section displays the city's current weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The 5-day forecast section displays forecasted weather, temperature, and humidity up to 5 days out. The UV Index in the current forecast changes colors depending on intensity. You can search by city name with the search bar or click on a previously searched city to load weather information. The dashboard saves your 10 most recent city searches.
